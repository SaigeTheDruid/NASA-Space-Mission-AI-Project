# NASA-Space-Mission-AI-Project
**Name:** Saige
**Track Chosen:** Conceptual Design Track  

### ðŸš€ Project Summary  
Space missions are incredibly complex, and even the smallest equipment failure can jeopardize astronaut safety or derail mission success. This project proposes a smart AI system designed to predict equipment failures before they happen. By analyzing real-time sensor data and past maintenance logs, the AI can alert astronauts to potential issues and recommend proactive steps to fix them. The goal? Keep missions running smoothly, reduce downtime, and add an extra layer of safety and support in space.

### ðŸ“– How to Use This Repo  
This repository includes all the key documents for the project:

- Start with `project_proposal.md` to get an overview of the problem and why it matters.  
- Then, check out `solution_plan.md` to see how the AI system is designed, what data it uses, and how it would work in practice.  
- Open `testing_plan.md` for a look at how the system would be tested, what success looks like, and how risks are handled.  
- Finally, browse the `presentation_slides.pdf` for a quick visual summary of the entire concept.

Each document builds on the lastâ€”feel free to explore them in order, or jump to the section you're most interested in!
