## About This Project  
This project is all about designing an AI system that can help predict when important spacecraft equipment might fail. Using data from sensors like temperature, vibration, power usage, and pressure, the AI would be able to give early warnings before something breaks down. The goal is to help astronauts and mission teams take action ahead of time, making space missions safer and more reliable.

## How to Use This Documentation  
This documentation is written to walk you through the entire project concept step by step. Here is how it is organized:

1. **Project Proposal:** What problem we are tackling, why it matters, and what we aim to achieve.  
2. **Detailed Solution Plan:** How the AI system would work, including data, model choices, and overall design.  
3. **Testing Plan:** How we plan to check that the system works well and is safe to use.  
4. **Presentation Slides:** A summary to clearly explain the project and its key points.
